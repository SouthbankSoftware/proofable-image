ProofableImage builds trust into your image by creating a blockchain certificate for it. The image certificate can not only prove the image as a whole but also prove the pixel boxes and the metadata inside it. For more details, please read through [this Medium post]().

If you want to prove your file system, please try out the [Proofable CLI](https://docs.proofable.io/cmd/proofable-cli/).

If you want to build trust into your own application, please check out the [Proofable Framework](https://proofable.io/).

## Usage

1. Download the binary for your system in [the GitHub Releases](). You can also build your own: `make`
2. Create an access token
3. Create an image certificate
4. Verify an image against the certificate
